# PyBer Analysis Report

## Background and Results

### Purpos
This analysis is to review the differences between the types in cities when it comes to rides, drivers and fare.

### Technical Analysis
The outcomes of this analysis was through review of different data sets between city and ride data.

### Results
Based on the review of the data there's some impact between the cost of fares and drivers that have an impact in amount of rides. Also based on the type of of city conditions can impact the cost in rides.

### Summary
Overall in reviewing the city types it is logical to say based on the outcomes from "Urban" city type the increase in rides and drivers in which shows more resources contribute to the average fare per ride and/or driver to be more cost effective.

## Challenges Encountered and Overcome


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

* Programming

* Data analysis - some of the challenges I encountered was in creating the summary data frame. I was able to pull the necessary data to build my summary but I had opportunities in taking the right steps to be able to format and create a summary data set that would be easily read by another.

* Graphing, etc - challenges encountered in graphing is having the correct set up to ensure the codes would align with Matplotlib rules and achieve the correct outcomes.

### Technical Analyses Used

## Recommendations and Next Steps
Based on this analysis I would recommend the CEO review the data of total drivers having a direct impact in the total number of rides and overall cost effectiveness per ride.

### Recommendations for Future Analysis

### Additional Analysis 1

* Description of Approach - I would recommend anylizing the factors that contribute to the overall drivers by city type. Is it based on the needs of the area? Or could it be a need of drivers and what can be changed to impact this?

* Technical Steps - Get insight from the CEO on additional data that can provide the processes that need to be improved to gain more drivers in underserved areas and overall impact the cost effectiveness per ride as well as the company's growth opportunities.
